# Log

Append-only chronological record of wiki activity. Newest at the bottom.

Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <subject>` followed by a short note.

## [2026-06-25] init | AIOS wiki scaffolded

Wiki created at `docs/wiki/`. 67 raw files ingested into 13+ curated pages across identity/, strategy/, research/, frameworks/, clients/, insights/, advisors/, concepts/.

## [2026-06-25] ingest | dispatch routing — Wild Rose, Refuge Sales, Osmani paper

Ingested 3 files staged by `/dispatch` from `/gemini-sweep` + inbox processing:

- **Updated**: `clients/wild-rose-project.md` — added Meghan Wymore and Katrina Williams to stakeholders table. Source: `raw/aios/2026-06-25-wild-rose-redesign-pre-launch-qa.md`.
- **Created**: `clients/refuge-sales-project.md` — new client brief for Thomas Rindfuss / Agrilogix water tech distributor. Source: `raw/aios/2026-06-24-refuge-sales-kickoff.md`.
- **Skipped**: `raw/research/2026-06-25-new-sdlc-vibe-coding-osmani.md` — `research/new-sdlc-vibe-coding.md` already exists and is curated. Routing stub is redundant.
- **Updated**: `index.md` — added Refuge Sales client entry.

## [2026-06-28] log | v2.0 milestone closed + client updates + wiki governance fix

**Milestone v2.0 shipped.** 6 phases, 15 plans, 24 days (2026-06-04 → 2026-06-28). Session state hooks, persistent todos, wiki filtering, scheduled triage, prospect pipeline, UI dispatcher cleanup. Tagged `v2.0`, archived to `.planning/milestones/`.

- **Updated**: `clients/wild-rose-project.md` — launch date → July 13, QA week of 7/7, HR printable app request, 3 bugs to fix before QA. Source: `raw/aios/2026-06-25-wild-rose-redesign-pre-launch-qa.md`.
- **Updated**: `clients/thermal-kitchen-project-plan.md` — launch date → Mon 7/6, social promos Wed 7/8, 98% complete, 7/1 review meeting. Source: `raw/aios/2026-06-26-thermal-kitchen-launch-confirmed.md`.
- **Updated**: `clients/tonequest-project.md` — meetings moved to Wed, website replaces Mailchimp as delivery channel, archive engine testing in year-clusters, Pelcro international subscriber issues. Source: `raw/aios/2026-06-26-tonequest-checkin.md`.
- **Fixed**: `WIKI-CLAUDE.md` — changed "inbox" language to "read-only source archive" for `raw/`. Was the only wiki using "inbox" framing; all project wikis and the template say "immutable/read-only." The mismatch caused a raw/ file deletion incident this session.

## [2026-06-28] log | day/night shift workflow research

- **Created**: `insights/day-night-shift-workflow.md` — feature development workflow modeled on Matt Pocock's video. Day shift (grill → PRD → issues), night shift (AFK agent loop pulls issues), next day (QA + bug filing). Retires `/ship`, `ce-brainstorm`, `ce-plan`, `ce-work`. Keeps CE back half (code-review, compound, simplify, debug). AFK runner is the missing build piece.
- **Updated**: `index.md` — added insights entry.

## [2026-06-28] log | full session wrap — v2.0 shipped, day/night shift workflow designed

Major session covering infrastructure fixes, milestone close, and operational research.

**Infrastructure:**
- AIOS UI chat: fixed date awareness (system clock with day name), added midnight session expiry with queued message carry-through.
- Wiki: fixed WIKI-CLAUDE.md "inbox" → "source archive", fixed 2 broken skill references in wiki-ingest pipeline (`/ingest-aios-drops` → `/wiki ingest`, `/llm-wiki` → `/wiki ingest`).
- CLAUDE.md: split staged ingestion rule (remote wikis stage to `raw/aios/`, claude-os writes directly).
- Curated 3 client pages: Wild Rose (launch → July 13), Thermal Kitchen (launch → Mon 7/6), ToneQuest (meetings → Wed, website replaces Mailchimp).

**Milestone v2.0:**
- Audited via `/gsd-audit-milestone` (24/31 requirements, 2 blockers found and fixed).
- Completed via `/gsd-complete-milestone` — archived to `.planning/milestones/`, tagged `v2.0`, pushed.

**Day/night shift workflow (operational research):**
- Researched Matt Pocock's feature-building process from video + skills repo.
- Designed 3 new skills: `/nightshift` (AFK agent loop), `/dev-feedback` (in-app bug button), updated `/wrap` (review before compound, claude-os writes directly).
- 5-round Codex adversarial review converged the design: timestamped branches, checkpoint resets, close-after-push, `execFileSync`, server-only API gate.
- Installed Matt's skills globally (35 skills to `~/.claude/skills/`). Key additions: `grilling`, `domain-modeling`, `codebase-design`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`, `prototype`, `qa`, `implement`.
- Updated `grill-me` to Matt's latest (delegates to `/grilling`).

## [2026-06-29] log | nightshift hardened + research sweep + ToneQuest Marker PRD

**Nightshift skill hardened (7 additions to `~/.claude/skills/nightshift/SKILL.md`):**
- `progress.md` — cross-issue sprint memory. Each agent reads + appends. Ephemeral per run.
- `fix_plan.md` — discovered work that isn't the current task. Auto-filed as GitHub issues after the loop.
- Health check between issues (step 4a) — run test suite cold before starting each issue. Abort if foundation is rotten.
- AIOS state signal (step 3) — writes "nightshift active" to `state/<slug>.md` at loop start so `/brief` knows a run is in flight.
- Wiki synthesis epilogue (step 7) — stages learnings from progress.md to project wiki `raw/aios/` if worth keeping.
- Auto-file discovered work (step 6) — reads fix_plan.md, creates GitHub issues labeled `ready-for-agent`.
- Dynamic dependency re-evaluation — fixed bug where the loop resolved blockers once at start. Now re-evaluates after each issue completes so newly unblocked issues enter the queue.

**Retro skill updated (`claude-os/.claude/skills/retro/SKILL.md`):**
- Added HARNESS FAILURE as 5th signal type — agent needed human help because repo lacked context/guardrails. Fix type: encode into repo (CLAUDE.md rule, structural test, lint rule, CONTEXT.md term).
- Added Garbage Collection section in report — quick-apply harness fixes, distinct from `/level-up` candidates. Origin: Ryan Lopopolo's "Garbage Collection Day" at OpenAI.

**Research sweep (6 sources scraped and evaluated):**
- Matt Pocock — Ralph Wiggum video: progress.txt pattern (applied), human-in-the-loop variant, PRD-as-checklist.
- Austin Marchese — BUILD framework: beginner-level, nothing applicable. 3-bucket improvement loop interesting but already covered by retro+level-up.
- Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) — practical tips talk: beginner-level for Justin's setup. Notable quote: "by end of year, people aren't using IDEs anymore."
- Ryan Lopopolo (OpenAI) — Harness Engineering keynote: Garbage Collection Day (applied to retro), structural tests concept (new guardrail type), "every continue is a harness failure" framing, non-functional requirements per-expertise.
- Geoffrey Huntley — "Everything is a Ralph loop": philosophy/manifesto, reverse-mode concept (audit loops). No skill changes.
- Kun Chen (L8 Principal) — risk-tiered PR review, First Mate pattern (future nightshift evolution), skills can hurt agents warning, token/iteration caps.
- Anthropic — Effective harnesses for long-running agents: initializer+coding agent pattern, feature list as JSON with passes flag, start-of-session health check (applied), progress file (applied).

**ToneQuest Marker integration:**
- Grilled Marker (VikParuchuri/marker) as replacement for ToneQuest's PyPDF2 text extraction. Conclusion: replace Stage 0 (preprocessing), not the whole pipeline. Claude shifts from vision-interpreting images to converting markdown → structured HTML.
- 10 design decisions locked via `/grill-me`.
- PRD posted: beardedgingerdesigns/toneuqest#2.
- 8 vertical-slice issues filed (#3-#10) via `/to-issues`. #3 (marker_extract.py) starts immediately. #4 (spike) is the quality gate.
- Setup Matt Pocock skills on ToneQuest repo (labels, docs/agents/, CLAUDE.md updated).

## [2026-06-29] ingest | BrandOS sequencing shift, Revolution re-engaged, Wild Rose QA

**Processed 8 raw/aios/ drops (2026-06-24 through 2026-06-29). 3 promoted, 5 skipped (already curated).**

**Revolution Drones** (`clients/revolution-drones-project.md`):
- Status updated from dormant (2026-05-02) to re-engaged (2026-06-29). Justin emailed Russell to restart manufacturer website. Jon nudging Russell same day. Now the near-term BrandOS manufacturer-tier entry point.

**Terraplex** (`clients/terraplex-platform.md`):
- Added "Relationship dynamics" section: investment freeze from Jon (2026-06-29), Cherity cost anxiety, engagement model update. Pricing conversation on ice.
- Productized checklist: pricing tiers and participation fee marked as frozen.

**Wild Rose** (`clients/wild-rose-project.md`):
- Added pre-launch QA section (2026-06-25 drop): July 13 launch confirmed, QA week of 7/7, HR printable app, SEO mapping, URL stability, Indeed integration.

**Skipped:**
- `2026-06-28-session-wrap-0900` — already curated in [2026-06-28] log entry.
- `2026-06-26-tonequest-checkin` — already curated into ToneQuest wiki page (status updated 2026-06-26).
- `2026-06-26-thermal-kitchen-launch` — already curated into TK timeline in [2026-06-28] log entry.
- `2026-06-25-session-wrap-0840` and `0910` — AIOS UI internals, already in [2026-06-28] log entry.
- `2026-06-24-refuge-sales-kickoff` — already curated into `clients/refuge-sales-project.md` in [2026-06-25] ingest.

**Other:**
- Fixed `.planning/STATE.md` — v2 progress stuck at 83% (5/6 phases). Updated to 100% (6/6) so statusline progress bar disappears.

## [2026-06-30] log | financials + Refuge Sales proposal + wiki architecture refactor

**Financials pull from Bonsai (live data, 2026-06-29):**
- BGD MRR: $5,850 gross, $5,350 normalized, $5,517/mo averaged. 18 recurring clients. $4,075 overdue ($3,675 is Jon).
- $10K MRR by EOY 2026 goal set. Pipeline mapped: Refuge Sales ($425), Russell/Revolution ($1,000+), ISF renegotiation ($600-800), Co-Line re-engagement ($300-400), BrandOS dealer layer ($20/dealer).
- **Updated**: `identity/financials.md` — BGD MRR section rewritten with live Bonsai numbers, pipeline with specific deal values, gap analysis.
- **Created**: `context/financials.md` — operational snapshot for session-level financial queries without pulling Bonsai.
- **Updated**: `context/priorities.md` — restructured around $10K MRR target. Pipeline table added. BrandOS reframed as marketing tool.

**Refuge Sales & Solutions proposal ($425/mo, 18-month term):**
- Wrote proposal (3 iterations: markdown in Docs, markdown v2, HTML), sent via Bonsai.
- Created Bonsai company, contact (Thomas Rindfuss), project (REF-0093, $425/mo retainer).
- **Updated**: `clients/refuge-sales-project.md` — billing ($425/mo), timeline (Phase 1: 3-4 weeks), Bonsai project, status.
- **Updated**: `state/refuge-sales.md` — proposal sent, next steps flipped to Thomas's court.
- Logged pricing decision to `decisions/log.md`. Marked todo complete.

**Wiki write architecture refactor (grill-me session, 13 questions):**
- Core rule: write directly to your own repo's wiki via `/wiki log`, stage to other repos' wikis via `raw/aios/`.
- PRD published (bgd-os#3), 5 vertical slice issues (#4-#8), all implemented via parallel agents, all closed.
- **Changed**: `/wrap` — removed `raw/aios/` staging, invokes `/wiki log` directly. No claude-os special case.
- **Changed**: `/dispatch` — writes AIOS wiki directly via `/wiki log`, removed inline `/wiki ingest`, classification-first rule added.
- **Changed**: `/gemini-sweep` — removed `aios-wiki` from `dispatch_to` hints. Courier only.
- **Changed**: `/brief` — added pending ingestion check across project wikis via `clients.yaml` `docs_paths`.
- **Added**: ADR 0004 addendum documenting the own-repo direct / cross-repo staged refinement.

**BrandOS strategy concept (not yet a decision):**
- Terraplex pricing frozen (Jon 2026-06-29). New concept: release BrandOS to Terraplex for free as portfolio piece, monetize at dealer level ($20/mo for advanced features). Removes Cherity budget dependency. Not logged as a decision yet — concept stage.

## [2026-06-30] lint | raw/ purge + index orphan fixes

Wiki lint pass triggered by OKF research session. Findings and fixes:

- **Purged**: 67 bootstrap raw files (committed 2026-06-28 during wiki init conversion). All had been processed by ingest agent — API reference dumps, superseded AIOS UI plans v0-v3, overnight research sweeps already synthesized into curated research/ pages. 10 real dispatch drops (meeting transcripts, client-specific drops) retained as provenance.
- **Fixed**: 2 orphan pages added to `index.md` — `identity/financials.md`, `strategy/site-manager.md`.
- **Noted (not fixed)**: 16 client pages have no cross-refs to strategy/research; 10 pages contain stale "deferred"/"TODO" markers; `strategy/brandos-roadmap.md` at 490 lines could benefit from splitting. These are structural improvements, not urgent.

## [2026-07-01] log | OKF research, wiki lint + purge, BrandOS pricing pivot handoff

Research session covering Google's Open Knowledge Format, wiki health, and BrandOS strategy handoff.

**OKF research:**
- Google's Open Knowledge Format (v0.1, published 2026-06-12) formalizes the LLM-wiki pattern (Karpathy) into a portable spec: markdown files + YAML frontmatter, one required `type` field, `index.md` for progressive disclosure, `log.md` for history. Vendor-neutral, no SDK.
- Justin's wiki methodology is a structural superset of OKF — same file format, same `index.md`/`log.md`, same cross-links. The one gap is YAML frontmatter (Justin's wikis use directory structure for typing instead). Decision: don't adopt OKF. Already past it. Add frontmatter only if 2RM hub project needs interoperability.
- 2RM "hubs" concept surfaced: agency wants client knowledge bases as hosted wikis any associate can query. Recommended architecture: markdown in git + MkDocs Material for browsable site + optional AI chat layer (phase 2). OKF frontmatter earns its keep here for search quality.

**Wiki lint + raw/ purge:**
- Ran `/wiki lint` on AIOS wiki. 9 checks. Findings: 0 dead links, clean log formatting, 2 orphan pages, 50+ unprocessed raw files, 16 client pages with no cross-refs, 10 pages with stale deferred/TODO markers, 5 large pages (200+ lines).
- Purged 67 bootstrap raw files (21K lines) — API reference dumps, superseded plans, overnight research sweeps already synthesized into curated pages. Retained 10 real dispatch drops as provenance.
- Fixed 2 index orphans (`identity/financials.md`, `strategy/site-manager.md`).
- Assessed remaining lint items: client page islands are fine as-is (useful self-contained briefs), stale TBDs are mostly legitimate wait-states or personal financial data only Justin can fill, large pages are appropriate reference documents.
- Raw/ immutability discussion: Karpathy's rule protects provenance (meeting transcripts backing curated claims). But API docs, superseded plans, and already-curated session wraps aren't provenance — they're clutter. Rule refined: raw/ is immutable for source material that backs curated claims; bootstrap migration artifacts are safe to delete after ingest.

**BrandOS pricing pivot handoff:**
- Staged handoff to `brandos/docs/wiki/raw/aios/2026-06-29-aios-sequencing-shift.md`. Covers: Terraplex investment freeze, Jon's drone product ask (I-19/R-40), Revolution re-engagement as manufacturer-tier entry point.
- Key addition: pricing pivot — BrandOS is free for distributors (the funnel), dealers pay for the website builder (the product). Flips revenue layer from distributor budget approval to dealer volume. Not yet a formal decision.

**Bonsai MCP assessment:**
- Invoice #1584 (ToneQuest, $450, scheduled 7/1) identified for cancellation — Bonsai MCP has no update/delete invoice action. Must cancel in Bonsai UI directly.
- Recommended leveraging: wire `list_invoices` into `/brief` for live overdue/upcoming financials (replaces stale `context/financials.md` snapshots), use deal pipeline tools to track pipeline in Bonsai instead of prose in `priorities.md`.

**Video research (2 videos screened):**
- Eric Tech "Claude Knowledge Base + Scheduled Loop" — same raw/wiki pattern, nothing new. His scheduled self-improving loop is the one gap vs Justin's setup; assessed as premature for a solo operator.
- Michele Torti "Claude Code Masterclass 4 Hours" — beginner content, nothing applicable.

**Bug noted:** `/to-prd` skill (user-level, `~/.claude/skills/to-prd/`) not resolving in project sessions even when explicitly typed as `/to-prd`. Has `disable-model-invocation: true` (intentional), but explicit slash command should still load. Potential Claude Code bug — flagged for issue filing.
